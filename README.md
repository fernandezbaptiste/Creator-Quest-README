Choose an Issue: Pick an issue that interests you. If you're new, look for "good first issue" tags.

Clone Your Fork: Clone your fork to your local machine. Use the command git clone <your-fork-url>.
Create a Branch: Create a new branch for your work. Use a descriptive name, like fix-login-bug or add-user-profile-page.


Step 3: Make Changes
Code: Implement your changes in your local repository. Make sure to keep your code clean and well-documented.
Commit Your Changes: Commit your changes with a clear commit message. For example, git commit -m "Fix login bug by updating auth logic".

Step 4: Submit a Pull Request
- Push your branch and changes to your fork on GitHub.
- Go to our repository on GitHub, and you'll see a prompt to create a pull request. Click on it, compare branches, and submit.
- Provide a detailed description of what changes you've made and why. Link the pull request to the issue it resolves.

Step 5: Review and Merge
Wait for Review: Our team will review your pull request, provide feedback or request changes if necessary.
Merge: Once your pull request is approved, one of our team members will merge it into the main codebase.
